now generate a markdown table with the following headers:

Type | Name | Description | Usage

For the following tools I created:

CODING_STYLE.md
directive.md
finish-session.md
start-session.md
update-roadmap.md
review-code.md
ROADMAP.md
backend-code-reviewer.md
flutter-implementation-coach.md
frontend-ux-specialist.md
session-optimizer.md
tech-writer.md
automation-sentinel.md

The table should sort them:
1. Agents first, then commands after, and finally File
2. There'll be only 3 categories: Agent, Command, File
3. All items alphabetically sorted


Example desired output

| Type | Name | Description | Usage |
|-------|---------|-------|-------------|
| Agent | automation-sentinel | meta-agent that does bla-bla-bla | used automatically (no user prompt needed) |
| Command | /resume-session | abcdef | abcdef |
| File | ROADMAP.md | aaaaaaaaaa | aaaaaaaaaa  |

So that I can paste to my article.
The table must be a summary, not a fully detailed description.
FOr the full description, people will refer to the original files.md listed above
